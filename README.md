## Overview
In this  multiplayer android game, you need to zap the asteroids in your path to gain points. The more asteroids you zap, the higher your score.<br/>
We implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for the project. This was a team effort and I worked on the View component of the pattern.
