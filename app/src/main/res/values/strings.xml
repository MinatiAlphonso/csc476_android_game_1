<h2>How to Play:</h2>
<p>
    This game is played in a series of rounds (you get to decide the number of rounds). During each round, players can select a Capture option from the available three. To zap the asteroids, hit the \"Capture!\" button. Each player has only one opportunity to apply their capture to the asteroids per turn. The game ends when either the number of rounds specified is over or if there are no more asteroids in the game board, whichever comes first. Each asteroid you capture adds +1 to your total score, so the player who has captured the greatest number of asteroids is the winner.
